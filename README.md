# SNHU-CS320

Testing is always the best way to validate that our code or software is functional. Giving in my project 1 you can see I deminstrated the use of unit testing
using JUnit 5. In order to interpret the user needs into a program the needs need to organized into requirements. This requirements need to be followed as well as tested in and outside
the scope of what is wanted. For example, an address but not be more than 20 characters. Not only to I make sure that if I use more than 20 characters that an exception in thrown,
but also validate that both below 20 and exactly 20 don't throw exceptions. I also validate that null can not be excepted. My current approuch is taking things one step at a time, while 
thinking of what may be needed in the current step that I'm on.
